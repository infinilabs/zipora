```

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

**Memory Layout Optimization:**
```rust
// Old approach: Fixed-size padding
data: Vec<u8>           // N bytes per string (padding waste)
len: usize              // String count

// New approach: Arena + bit-packed indices
string_arena: Vec<u8>   // Variable-length string data  
indices: Vec<u32>       // Packed (offset:24, length:8)
```

**Bit-Packing Strategy:**
- **Offset**: 24 bits (16MB arena capacity)
- **Length**: 8 bits (255 byte max string length)
- **Total**: 32 bits vs 64+ bits for separate fields
- **Savings**: 50-67% index metadata reduction

**Zero-Copy Access Pattern:**
```rust
// Direct arena slice access - no copying
let packed = self.indices[index];
let offset = (packed & 0x00FFFFFF) as usize;
let length = (packed >> 24) as usize;
&self.string_arena[offset..offset + length]
```
